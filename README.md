  SQL Challenge: Creating queries by using data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis
## Requirements
  - Data Modeling
    - Create a Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. 

  - Data Engineering
    - Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following: 
        - Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints 
        - For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite key, which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row
        - Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys. 
    - Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table. 

  - Data Analysis
        - List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
        - List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
        - List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
        - List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
        - List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
        - List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
        - List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
        - List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

## Installation and Configuration 
	- Postgres SQL/pgAdmin 4
	
	- Files included with repository include the CSV file code, README, SQL queries, picture of ERD. 
    - Updated the formatting for importing the CSV files when dollars were used to 2 decimal places. 
    - Also learned to use short cuts for the SQL queries to shorten the character counts. (ex. e, for "Employee", s for "Salaries" that were found in the CSV files provided)
